# Incidents â€“ Communal Incident Reporting

Incidents is a modern application designed to simplify public incident reporting and management. Originally developed as a graduation project, it connects citizens with municipal services through a responsive and secure platform.  
This version is implemented using Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for the mobile client, integrating with a shared backend API. The focus is on a clean, maintainable architecture and smooth user experience across devices.  
This project started as my graduation project for my Computing Science Associate Degree in C# and has been rewritten in Kotlin, in collaboration with Avans University of Applied Sciences.

## Key Points
- Mobile client built in Jetpack Compose (Android).  
- Communicates with a shared REST API backend.  
- Role-based access and secure user authentication.  
- Streamlined UI for reporting and tracking incidents.  

## Goal
To enhance communication between citizens and municipal services, enabling efficient, transparent handling of public incidents.
